Flow of the AES CPU program

1. Main function does 
a. Takes in the input file name 
b. Pads the data accordingly
c. Generates the Key
d. Call the AES encrypt function
e. Writes ciphertext to the file
f. Decrypts the cipheretext

What does AES encrypt demo do?
Initializes the key -> Creates the Round keys?
Also copies the key into two separate encryption and decryption keys
Calls the encrypt function in a serial manner? (Place for parallelization)?

How does the AES_expandEncKey function work? 

To understand the arguments see how the function is called

Is it hardcoded for 256 or can it be configured for 128 and 192? Hardcoded for 256





What does the aes256_encrypt function do?
void *memcpy(void *dest, const void * src, size_t n)

Calls the Roundkey_cpy function

Performs the AES rounds

Starting from 1 to Nr-1
(Nr-1) iterations

Then some funky mumbo jumbo
